# Hi there 👋, I'm Haq!

💡 Senior Cyber Security Engineer | GRC Enthusiast | SecOps Specialist | VA & OffSec Explorer | Shift Left ⬅️
   
## 🚀 About Me
I **live at the intersection** **of** governance, risk, and compliance **(GRC)**, security operations **(SecOps), and offensive security**. I enjoy turning complex security challenges into simple, actionable solutions that actually work for people. When offline, I drive 🚗 and explore 🌇.

  
## 🔒 What drives me:

- Building strong governance and compliance frameworks 📜 without making them feel like red tape.

- Jumping into Security Operations 🛡️, monitoring, hunting, and incident response.

- Digging into vulnerabilities 🐛 and finding the “what if” before attackers do.

- Constantly leveling up my OffSec skills 🎯, because offense sharpens defense.
